## Dataset statistics
We divided the Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017 datasets into three parts: training set, development set, and validation set. These two Twitter datasets contain a large number of tweets and rich image information, and are widely used in natural language processing and social media analysis. The following are statistical information tables for two datasets.
